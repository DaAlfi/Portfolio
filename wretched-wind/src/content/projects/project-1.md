Tschos Adventure is an exciting 2D jump-and-run game that I developed together with two project members in my third year. The game features multiple levels that are not only challenging but also highly diverse. Its unique graphics, entirely designed by me, give the game its distinct charm. All designs were crafted with great attention to detail using Photoshop and Illustrator, while the game itself was brought to life in Unity. 
From the initial concept to the final product, Tschos Advenger is a passion project that combines creativity with technical expertise.
