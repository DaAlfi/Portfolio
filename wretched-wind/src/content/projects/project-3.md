The project was created out of the need to modernize and digitize the company's work processes. Currently, employee data, working hours, and tasks are managed using Excel spreadsheets, which need to be manually updated and printed. This time-consuming and error-prone process leads to communication problems, as information is not updated in real-time and access to current data is limited.

The idea for the project was developed after consulting with the company, which recognized the need for an optimized, user-friendly solution for daily work planning. In the future, employees will be able to access their working hours, to-do lists, and instructions through the portal. At the same time, administrators will be able to manage data efficiently and make real-time adjustments. A key factor in the decision to implement this project was the ability to manage and edit the application by multiple administrators and a main administrator at the various locations of the lift company.
