In the 3rd grade, I developed a 2D survival game called "Survival Ignaz" with two other project members. In this game, players must survive multiple waves of zombies and strategically fight against them. The game features different phases and unique graphics that I designed myself. It was implemented in Unity, while the design was created in Photoshop and Illustrator.
