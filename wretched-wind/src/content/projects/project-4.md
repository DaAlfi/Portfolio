The project, titled "BärBot," involves the development of a robot that can be remotely controlled via both a computer and a mobile device. The robot includes several key features: 1. Suicide Prevention Feature – The robot is equipped with a safety feature that prevents it from crashing into walls. This feature can be turned on or off as needed. 2. Line Following Mode – Using a light sensor, the robot can follow a line, providing a more autonomous navigation option. 3. Robot and Application Requirements – The application will display all robot values (sensors/actuators) and will update them regularly. Users will be able to send commands to the robot (e.g., move forward) and adjust its speed. Additionally, the application will allow users to change the color of the robot’s five LED lights. Network Connections – Both the robot and the application will connect to the school’s Wi-Fi network automatically, allowing them to discover each other. Once connected, the robot will start accepting commands and sending data back to the application. The robot will display its status through its LEDs: Blue – Connecting Green – Successful Wi-Fi connection Green- – IP address displayed on the screen for 5 seconds (Connection successful) Red – Wi-Fi connection error
